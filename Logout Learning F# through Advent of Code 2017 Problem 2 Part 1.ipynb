This should seem strange to you, as we were just talking about an array of strings. It turns out it's fairly easy to go from an array of one primitive value to a list of another primitive value. Since I prefer working with lists and the problem requires integers, I've decided to write this as if I've already done the conversions. We'll see exactly how this works in the final function.\n",
